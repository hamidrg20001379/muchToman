/**
 * The five places the app goes, and the way back from any of them.
 *
 * Before this there was no way home except the system back button: every screen was an overlay
 * with a «بستن» in the corner, and overlays over overlays meant she could get somewhere she
 * could not get out of. A bar that is always there is not only tidier, it is the fix.
 *
 * آینده is a root because it holds the things she manages ahead of time: the caps she keeps per
 * category, the savings goals under them, and her own verdict on her own spending. It was «هدف‌ها»
 * while a goal was all it held, and «بودجه» once the caps outgrew the goals — and each of those
 * names claimed one section of a screen that holds three, so a tab named after any of them is a
 * tab she does not open looking for the other two. What the sections share is the only word that
 * covers them: every one is about money she has not spent yet. The report is here because "بیشتر شده یا
 * کمتر؟" is a question she asks as often as "چقدر دارم؟", and as an overlay every door into it
 * was on خانه — a screen she has to be standing on to remember the report exists at all.
 *
 * The household is not here. It is the one thing on this list she sets up once and then never
 * opens again, and a slot on this bar is rent paid every day; it lives at the top of تنظیمات
 * now, which is where the other once-and-done things already are.
 *
 * ## Why it looks like this
 *
 * A floor, not an island: full width, opaque, and held to the page by a hairline rather than a
 * shadow — Wise's own move, and Material's. An island floating clear of the edges read as a
 * second hero, and an app gets one face. The bar is furniture.
 *
 * Still drawn by hand, because 64dp is the most five words she reads every day have earned,
 * and the glyphs are the app's own pen. The pill under the tab she is on measures exactly what
 * M3's indicator measures (56×32) and wears the soft green container rather than the full
 * brand fill: it answers *where am I*, and the loud fill is reserved for *press this*.
